Extremely Loud Correct Buzzer

I don't know what I am doing, but this is an attempt at gamifying the R `lintr` package
by wrapping it in a function that plays a bell when the linter does not identify an issue, 
or reacts appropriately when it does.

Most of this is created using a lot of help from GH CoPilot and ChatGPT, I don't actually really know what I am doing.
But it seems to work locally! Pavlov would be proud.
